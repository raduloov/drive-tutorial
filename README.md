### Folder deletions

Make sure you fetch all of the folders that have its as a parent and their children too.

### Folder creations

Make a server actions that takes a name and a parentId, and creates a folder with that name and parentId (don't forget to set the ownerId).

### Access control

Check if user is owner before showing the folder page.

### Make a "file view" page
